Query Analyst Agent for SMITE 2 Combat Log Agent.

This module implements the Query Analyst Agent responsible for:
1. Analyzing the user's query to understand intent and required data
2. Identifying key entities, metrics, and dimensions in the query
3. Categorizing the query type (combat analysis, timeline analysis, etc.)
4. Setting up the query for downstream agents
5. Enhancing the query with domain-specific knowledge

The agent includes integration with a validation guardrail to ensure
query understanding accuracy.
