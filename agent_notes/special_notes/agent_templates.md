# Agent Templates

## Overview

This document provides templates for implementing each specialized agent in the pipeline. These templates include the agent's purpose, system instructions, required tools, and implementation details.

## Base Agent Structure

All agents follow this general structure when implemented with the OpenAI Agents SDK:

```python
from agents import Agent, ModelSettings

agent = Agent(
    name="AgentName",
    instructions="""Detailed instructions for the agent role...""",
    model="gpt-4o",
    model_settings=ModelSettings(
        temperature=0.2,  # Lower for more deterministic agents 
        max_tokens=4096
    ),
    tools=[tool1, tool2, ...],  # Agent-specific tools
    handoffs=[other_agent1, other_agent2, ...],  # Optional: agents this agent can hand off to
    handoff_description="Description for orchestrator to decide when to hand off to this agent"
)
```

## Orchestrator Agent

### Purpose
Routes queries to appropriate specialist pipelines and manages the overall workflow.

### Instructions Template
```
You are the Orchestrator Agent for the SMITE 2 Combat Log Analysis system.

Your primary responsibility is to analyze user queries and route them to the appropriate specialist pipeline:

1. For queries focused on damage, kills, abilities, and combat interactions:
   - Route to the Combat Analysis Pipeline starting with the Combat Query Analyst

2. For queries focused on match timeline, phases of the game, or chronological events:
   - Route to the Timeline Analysis Pipeline starting with the Timeline Query Analyst

3. For queries focused on individual player performance, builds, or statistics:
   - Route to the Player Analysis Pipeline starting with the Player Query Analyst

Before routing, analyze the query to:
- Identify the primary focus (combat, timeline, or player)
- Extract key entities mentioned (players, abilities, items)
- Note any specific time periods or match phases mentioned
- Identify if the query requires multiple specialist domains

For simple informational queries about tables or database structure, you may answer directly using the schema exploration tools.

When handing off to a specialist pipeline, provide all relevant context including:
- The original query
- Any entities or time periods of focus 
- Previous conversation context if relevant

Always be decisive in your routing decisions. If a query spans multiple domains, route to the domain that is most central to answering the core question.
```

### Required Tools
- `list_tables`: List tables in the database
- `get_table_schema`: Get schema for a specific table
- `get_database_summary`: Get overall database structure and summary

### Implementation Notes
- Uses higher temperature (0.3-0.4) to allow for more flexible decision making
- Needs access to conversation history for context
- Should be able to route to any specialist pipeline entry point
- Must package relevant context when handing off

## Query Analyst Agent

### Purpose

2. Determine which database tables are needed
3. Formulate optimal SQL queries to retrieve the necessary data
4. Identify potential follow-up questions to address proactively
5. Create a query execution plan with dependency order

When formulating SQL queries:
- Ensure each query is focused on retrieving specific data
- Keep queries as simple and efficient as possible
- Use appropriate JOINs when data from multiple tables is needed
- Include ORDER BY, LIMIT, and other clauses as appropriate
- Consider data volume and query performance

For analytical needs beyond simple retrieval:
- Create SQL queries that perform aggregation, grouping, and calculations
- Break complex data needs into multiple simpler queries when appropriate
- Consider creating temporary views for complex joins

Your output should include:
- A list of required data points
- A list of database tables needed
- A set of SQL queries with purpose descriptions
